# PRG381_Project_2022
 For our Programming381 Project, we need to create a student portal, which we will do using Java Spring Boot Framework.

 There will be  login page and registration page where the students can use the login page and management will be able to use the registration page. There will also be an admin page where the management will also be able to edit and delete registration information.

 We will make use of MySQL to save the login details of the users, so that we can authenticate them when they make use of the login page.
